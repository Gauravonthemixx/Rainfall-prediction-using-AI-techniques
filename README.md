# 🚀 Rainfall-prediction-using-AI-techniques 🌧️🌧️

## :pencil: Description:
* This project focuses on leveraging artificial intelligence (AI) techniques to analyze historical weather data and predict rainfall occurrences in Australia. 
* By examining various environmental factors such as temperature, humidity, wind patterns, and cloud cover, the project aims to develop a robust predictive model for forecasting rain occurrences on the next day. 
* The ultimate goal is to showcase the potential of AI in weather analysis and prediction, contributing to more accurate and reliable weather forecasts for different sectors relying on weather information.

## :hourglass: Dataset:
* The dataset used in this analysis consists of historical weather data collected from various locations in Australia spanning from 2009 to 2017. 
* It contains 22 independent features, including measurements recorded at two different times of the day (9 am and 3 pm), such as temperature, rainfall, wind speed, humidity, and atmospheric pressure. Additionally, the dataset includes a binary target variable indicating whether it will rain tomorrow. 
* With 145,460 data points, this dataset serves as a valuable resource for studying weather patterns and predicting rainfall occurrences.
